## Business Context

You are part of a fintech startup that needs to build the core service for its new payment gateway. The system will allow users to make payments through multiple methods and process refunds. It should be easy to extend when new payment types or features are introduced in the future.

## Scenario

The company wants to launch a basic version of its payment platform that supports different payment options such as credit cards, PayPal, and cryptocurrency. Each payment type has its own processing logic, data, and validation rules. The system should also maintain records of successful and failed transactions for auditing and reporting purposes.

## Business Requirements

1. The system should support multiple types of payments including:
   - Credit card payments
   - PayPal transactions
   - Cryptocurrency wallet transfers

2. Each payment type should have its own specific data and validation.  
   For example:
   - Credit cards require card number, CVV, and expiry date.
   - PayPal requires an email and authentication token.
   - Cryptocurrency requires a wallet address.

3. The payment gateway should allow users to:
   - Make a payment for a given amount.
   - Request a refund for a previous transaction.

4. The system should keep a record of all payment attempts, including:
   - Payment method used
   - Amount
   - Transaction identifier
   - Result (success or failure)
   - Timestamp
   - Additional metadata if needed

5. The design should allow adding new payment types in the future without major code changes.

6. The gateway should be able to handle multiple payment operations in a session, maintaining any necessary state such as balances or transaction logs.

7. If a payment fails (for example, due to invalid details or insufficient funds), an appropriate error or message should be recorded and displayed.

8. The transaction log should allow flexibility to store different kinds of data based on payment type, customer information, or any future extensions.

9. The system should simulate real-world conditions, for example:
   - Randomly fail some transactions to test error handling.
   - Include processing delays or validation checks.
   - Produce console logs or output that mimic real payment flow.

10. At the end of the exercise, each team will run a short demo showing:
    - A few successful and failed payment attempts.
    - A refund operation.
    - The final state of the system (for example, a printed transaction log).

## Constraints

- The application should be simple enough to implement within an hour but realistic enough to represent an actual payment serviceâ€™s logic.
- Teams should design it so that future enhancements like loyalty points, multi-currency handling, or recurring payments could be added easily.

## Deliverables

Each group should produce:
- A working prototype of the payment gateway system.
- A transaction report or output summary that shows the payment flow.
- A short presentation explaining:
  - System design and key decisions.
  - How it can be extended to support new payment methods or additional features.



## Presentation

Each group will present their implementation and briefly explain:
- The business flow they designed.
- How payments and refunds are processed.
- How transaction records are managed.
- How their design could scale to support more payment methods or future business requirements.
- Go concepts and design choices
